Here is the supplementary page of the paper: Transfer Learning for Improving Singing Voice Detection in Polyphonic Music.


There are detailed files in the folders.

It is noteworthy that after transfer learning, the CRNN model in the target task detected the “thanks” voice of the singer to the audience at the concert, at 4:39 seconds of the fourth song named “Mote.wav”. However, the baseline system did not detect it. This may be due to the speech data in the original task has voice samples related to "thank you", and after transfer learning, the CRNN model in the target task absorbed these knowledge.
